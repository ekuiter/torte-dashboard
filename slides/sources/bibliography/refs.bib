abstract = {Today, the operating system Linux is widely used in diverse environments, as its kernel can be configured flexibly. In many configurable systems, managing such variability can be facilitated in all development phases with product-line analyses. These analyses often require knowledge about the system's features and their dependencies, which are documented in a feature model. Despite their potential, product-line analyses are rarely applied to the Linux kernel in practice, as its feature model still challenges scalability and accuracy of analyses. Unfortunately, these challenges also severely limit our knowledge about two fundamental metrics of the kernel's configurability, namely its number of features and configurations. We identify four key limitations in the literature related to the scalability, accuracy, and influence factors of these metrics, and, by extension, other product-line analyses: (1)&nbsp;Analysis results for the Linux kernel are not comparable, because relevant information is not reported; (2)&nbsp;there is no consensus on how to define features in Linux, which leads to flawed analysis results; (3)&nbsp;only few versions of the Linux kernel have ever been analyzed, none of which are recent; and (4)&nbsp;the kernel is perceived as complex, although we lack empirical evidence that supports this claim. In this paper, we address these limitations with a comprehensive, empirical study of the Linux kernel's configurability, which spans its feature model's entire history from 2002 to 2024. We address the above limitations as follows: (1)&nbsp;We characterize parameters that are relevant when reporting analysis results; (2)&nbsp;we propose and evaluate a novel definition of features in Linux as a standardization effort; (3)&nbsp;we contribute torte, a tool that analyzes arbitrary versions of the Linux kernel's feature model; and (4)&nbsp;we investigate the current and possible future configurability of the kernel on more than 3,000 feature-model versions. Based on our results, we highlight eleven major insights into the Linux kernel's configurability and make seven actionable recommendations for researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {Software Product Lines (SPLs) are a common technique to capture families of software products in terms of commonalities and variabilities. On a conceptual level, functionality of an SPL is modeled in terms of features in Feature Models (FMs). As other software systems, SPLs and their FMs are subject to evolution that may lead to the introduction of anomalies (e.g., non-selectable features). To fix such anomalies, developers need to understand the cause for them. However, for large evolution histories and large SPLs, explanations may become very long and, as a consequence, hard to understand. In this paper, we present a method for anomaly detection and explanation that, by encoding the entire evolution history, identifies the evolution step of anomaly introduction and explains which of the performed evolution operations lead to it. In our evaluation, we show that our method significantly reduces the complexity of generated explanations.},

	abstract = {A software product line is a set of program variants, typically generated from a common code base. Feature models describe variability in product lines by documenting features and their valid combinations. In product-line engineering, we need to reason about variability and program variants for many different tasks. For example, given a feature model, we might want to determine the number of all valid feature combinations or compute specific feature combinations for testing. However, we found that contemporary reasoning approaches can only reason about feature combinations, not about program variants, because they do not take abstract features into account. Abstract features are features used to structure a feature model that, however, do not have any impact at implementation level. Using existing feature-model reasoning mechanisms for program variants leads to incorrect results. Hence, although abstract features represent domain decisions that do not affect the generation of a program variant. We raise awareness of the problem of abstract features for different kinds of analyses on feature models. We argue that, in order to reason about program variants, abstract features should be made explicit in feature models. We present a technique based on propositional formulas that enables to reason about program variants rather than feature combinations. In practice, our technique can save effort that is caused by considering the same program variant multiple times, for example, in product-line testing.},
