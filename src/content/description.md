To be edited in `src/content/description.md`.

## Modification

Two things to consider when writing this description:

        1. Bullet points and code blocks need to be indented twice to be visualized  correctly.
        2. Non-hyperlinks (i.e., links that evoke a jump inside the same page) are not supported as of now.
